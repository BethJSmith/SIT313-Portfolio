# Password Encryption App

Completed first Android app using the [Hello, Android](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/getting_started/hello,android/hello,android_quickstart/) tutorial at Xamarin.

I changed up the content a bit and ended up making a password encrypter and decrypter app. Typing in a word will show you an encrypted version. There is also an option to unencrypt a word.

This app is compatible with Android.

## How to run

To run the following app you must have Xamarin.Android installed on your machine. Download the folder named 'PasswordEncryption' to a local location. Load the AndroidAdd.sln file in Visual Studio to view the solution. Click debug to run the app in the Android simulator.
