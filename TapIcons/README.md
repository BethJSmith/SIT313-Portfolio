# Tap Icons App

Based on the week 1 exercise to tap the screen and turn off a lightbulb.

Tapping the blank tile will shows a random coloured tile and tapping it again will hide it.

This was made as a test run for my project 1 by making use of a random number generator to randomly pick a tile. In my project I will have the tiles randomly placed and revealed when the user taps it.
